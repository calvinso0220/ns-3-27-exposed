I am trying to modify ns-3 so that a node can cancel reception right after reading the preamble, and regard the signal as interference.
First, I need to figure out how the receiving process is implemented. There was a significant change in ns-3.27 regarding packet reception, so I am going to make notes while I understand and modify the code.
